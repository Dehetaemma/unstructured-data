As we know, AI technologies will most likely create a different set of
employability-related challenges for data scientists in certain parts of the world while
generating multiple opportunities in other parts of the world. Indeed, experts are
predicting that for some regions of the world in South Asia, generative AI will create
relief and opportunities for many entry-level workers. At the root of this, we believe that
data science roles and their responsibilities differ across regions, impacting salary
disparities within countries. Our analysis examines text to uncover trends and
relationships between job roles, salaries, and geographic variations, providing insights
into the evolving data science industry.
Our project questions are as follows:


● What are the skills/salary trends for data-related roles when considering
country and GDP?
● Do variables such as job category, company size, and education level affect
salary-related findings and interact with job location?



Text Mining
Text mining is a powerful tool for extracting valuable insights from textual data, a
process that's particularly relevant when analyzing datasets consisting of job
descriptions in the data industry. By deploying text mining techniques, an individual can
effectively decipher the large volumes of unstructured data to identify key terms,
discern patterns, and uncover underlying themes that might not be immediately
apparent. This method not only facilitates the identification of frequently occurring
words but also aids in the aggregation of similar terms to reveal prevalent themes and
trends.
The primary advantage of using text mining in the context of this project is that it allows
those new to the data sector, to gain a deep understanding of the landscape of job
opportunities. Analyzing the most commonly mentioned words in job descriptions can
highlight the roles that are in highest demand, guiding job seekers towards the most
lucrative and demanded positions. Similarly, focusing on the skills section of these jobs
can inform aspiring data professionals about the specific competencies that are
currently valued in the industry. This knowledge is instrumental in directing their
personal development efforts through self-study or formal education.
